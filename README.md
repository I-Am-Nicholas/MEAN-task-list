## Overview

  An app to improve my Node.js skills and to introduce me to NoSQL databases and asynchronous operations.

## Issues
  Every article I find that seems to expertly outline what an integration test is and how one should go about performing them, is peppered in the comments with those who believe the blogger to be describing either end-to-end or unit tests.

  The only thing anyone seems able to agree on is that integration tests fall somewhere between the two, and that each test should involve the interaction between components of the app.

  Negotiating the asynchronous handling.
